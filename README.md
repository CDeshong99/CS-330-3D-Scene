# Final Project Reflection
This project represents a culmination of my work in developing a 3D scene using C++ and OpenGL. It showcases my approach to software design, program development, and how I plan to leverage computer science to meet my educational and professional goals.
# How do I approach designing software?
New Design Skills: Through this project, I enhanced my understanding of modular design by breaking down my application into manageable components like SceneManager, ViewManager, and ShaderManager. I learned how to architect a graphics project that balances readability, performance, and scalability.

Design Process: I followed an iterative design process. Initially, I drafted basic functionality for loading and rendering 3D shapes, then gradually integrated shaders and views. Each component was tested independently before being integrated into the full system.

Future Application: These tactics will be vital in future projects, especially those requiring scalable architecture. The ability to separate concerns cleanly will allow for better collaboration and easier debugging.
# How do I approach developing programs?
New Development Strategies: I employed a strategy focused on frequent testing and modular coding. Working with a scene graph helped manage rendering complexities and object hierarchies within the 3D environment.

Role of Iteration: Iteration was key. I frequently compiled and ran the application to test new features, which allowed for quick identification and resolution of issues.

Evolution of Approach: Initially, I approached the codebase linearly. Over time, I shifted towards a more object-oriented mindset, organizing logic into classes and methods that reflected their responsibilities more clearly, which was critical in achieving project milestones.
# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Educational Pathway: Computational graphics and visualizations have given me hands-on experience with linear algebra, transformation matrices, and real-time rendering, which are foundational for advanced studies in graphics or game development.

Professional Pathway: Professionally, these skills are directly applicable to careers in software development, particularly in industries focused on simulation, visualization, or interactive media. This project also helped me build a tangible artifact for my portfolio, showcasing my capabilities in real-world applications of computer science.
